# in this project

In this project, we make an attempt at transfer learning to use pre-existing learned parameters to help us downstream a different task. We simplify our task to a classification task, however this classification requires learned parameters from two seperate encoders: an image, and a text encoder. ![Our architecture]()

We start by loading our dataset. The dataset we are using is the DAQUAR dataset (the Dataset on Question answering on Real-world images) which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tezansahu/processed-daquar-dataset) 
```python
